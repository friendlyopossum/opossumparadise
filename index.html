            <p id="description">Here I will be pretty much using all of my skills as I learn them. Right now everything may seem rudimentary, but that is entirely what growth is about.</p>
        <h2 id="section 2">Here I will be testing out several different types of buttons</h2>
            <div class="form-group">
                <p>These will be radio buttons, they are basic selectors of "Do I want this one, or this one??"</p>
                <label class="label1"><input name="user-select" type="radio" value="yes" class="input-radio">This is what a radio button looks like.</label>
                <label class="label1"><input name="user-select" type="radio" value="maybe" class="input-radio">This is going to be a button that when selected opens a text box to type into</label>
                <label class="label1"><input name="user-select" type="radio" value="also-maybe" class="input-radio">I just really wanted to put another button here lol.</label>
            </div>
    <h3 id="section 3">Here I am going to try and put some boxes, maybe floating boxes, not entirely sure how to do that, but I am going to be putting in some work, so, hopefully I can make it work. ðŸ˜…</h3>
            <div class="boxes">
                <div class="one">
                    <div class="box-top"><p class="top-inside">I don't know lol</p></div>
                    <div class="box-bottom"><p class="bottom-inside">This is a good example of text in a bottom box. here's a shark emoji ðŸ¦ˆ</p> </div>

                <div class="two">
                    <div class="box-top"><p class="top-inside">Box twosies</p></div>
                    <div class="box-bottom"><p class="bottom-inside">Here we are going to demonstrate that text is all a different color if we want it to be</p></div>
                </div>
                    <div class="three">
                        <div class="box-top"><p class="top-inside">And last one c:</p></div>
                    <div class="box-bottom"><p class="bottom-inside2">And this is a prime example of basic boxes with tab like labels. This third box has slightly smaller text since we were putting more words in it.</p></div>
